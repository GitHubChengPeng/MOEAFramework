# J3 - Java 3D Visualization Tool

We also developed a desktop application for creating interactive 2D and 3D visualizations.  This tool can be installed
from https://github.com/Project-Platypus/J3.

## Example

As an example, let's solve the 3-objective DLTZ2 problem using NSGA-II and save the approximation set to a CSV file:

```java

Problem problem = new DTLZ2(3);
		
NSGAII algorithm = new NSGAII(problem);
algorithm.setInitialPopulationSize(500);
algorithm.run(100000);
		
algorithm.getResult().asTabularData().saveCSV(new File("output.csv"));
```

Then, launch J3 and open `output.csv`.  The initial 3D plot will look random due to how the axes are configured.
Click the options button and set the X / Y / Z axes to display `Obj1`, `Obj2`, and `Obj3`:

You should then see a 3D scatter plot similar to:

From the Widgets button, you can add additional visualizations, such as a parallel coordinates plot:

Lastly, all of these plots are interactive.  For example, clicking on a point will highlight that record:
